Templates for the Android ADT tooling
=====================================

A template for a simple Android Hello world application. After download, copy the content of the files into your ADT installation directory into the `<android-sdk-folder>/tools/templates/` folder. **Note** that the content of the download must be extracted into this directory, e.g. the content of the project `activities` folder must be placed into the `<android-sdk-folder>/tools/templates/activities` folder.

If you created a new Android project via the following menu path you can select your new templates in the wizard.

**File > New > Android Application Project**
